# Diabetes-Analysis-and-Prediction

I carried out analysis and built a predictive model for diabetes diagnoses using the dataset which is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

The World Health Organisation stated that about 422 million people worldwide have diabetes, the majority living in low-and middle-income countries, and 1.5 million deaths are directly attributed to diabetes each year. This implies that the fight against diabetes should constitute a global effort.
## Cause of Diabetes
Diabetes occurs when blood glucose or blood sugar decomes excess in the body. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy.
## Approach
Predicted the onset of diabetes based on diagnostic measures.
### Dataset
The dataset used in this pipeline is the Pima Indian Diabetes.

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

#### Dataset features
The datasets consist of several medical predictor (independent) variables and one target (dependent) variable, Outcome. This include:

* Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
* Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
* BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
* SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
* Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
* BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
* DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
* Age: Age (years)
* Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1) 268 of 768 are 1, the others are 0
